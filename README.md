# Exam Slammr

## Personas
There are 3 personas within the application:
1. Question Contributor
1. Question Reviewer
1. Exam Taker

The 3 personas are not mutually exclusive or independent of each other. A given user could take on any one of these 
personas, or more likely, would be a combination. For example, a user may contribute questions, but also review the 
posted questions from other users.

### Question Contributor
Peter is a Question Contributor. He is a member of the Exam Slammr community by virtue of having registered
an account, and has a level of experience in his subject that means he can post subject specific questions with
a collection of answer choices.

### Question Reviewer
Sarah is a Question Reviewer. She is a member of the Exam Slammr community and has shown a level of subject expertise
through contributing questions that have been reviewed and approved by other Question Reviewers. Her high level reputation
within the community means that she can find unapproved questions that have been contributed by other Question Contributors,
review them for accuracy, comment if necessary, and approve them.  
To become a Question Reviewer, Sarah has earned a level of reputation by contributing great questions; therefore as well
as being a Question Reviewer, Sarah is also a Question Contributor.  
Whilst Sarah is a Question Reviewer (and by extension, a Question Contributor), she cannot approve her own questions.

### Exam Taker
Shripal is an Exam Taker. He may or may not be an Exam Slammr community member, so may be using the site anonymously.  
Shripal can search for questions that have been reviewed and approved by a Question Reviewer and collate them into a
mock test.
